    So I got myself in a bit of a pickle tonight. I wanted to go out to the bar
    but I had a bunch of things to do first . Had to deliver some milk to the 
    local store "Door bell noises" then travel all over town to attend some 
    meetings that could have been an email. The worst part of it all was the 
    traffic , it was ridiculous I swear I was moving an inch a minute "car honk"
    and I hadnt eaten all day . So I got home . Took a quick shower "shower noises "
    put on my nice clothes "zipper closing" and headed out the door "door sound"
    I arrived at the pub around 9 it was very lively , many people chatting 
    there was drinking "water filling" and the usual people playing pool "ball clanking"
    after some heavy drinking I was chatting with some sketchy people.One thing led 
    to another and we we're having a drinking contest . Before I knew it I ended 
    up passed out at a hotel with a bunch of stangers .No idea what happened but 
    someone beside me told me "you done some shit"
